# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction
The project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a company going bankrupt using a Machine Learning ALgorithm. The data set is fetched from Kaggle including various observed data of past years, and the goal was to predict the same with the highest possible accuracy.

# Introduction
Company Bankruptcy Prediction is a precise prediction of whether a company will be bankrupt using the Logistic Regression model, a Machine Learning Algorithms classification model.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves the distribution of bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy classes in the dataset. It includes visualizing the distribution in the form of a bar plot.
